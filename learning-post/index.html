      <div class = "q"> <p>Prompt: Why do you think teachers are so hesitant to provide children with direct instruction?</p> </div>
      <div class = "a"> <p>Teachers, especially if their instruction is not understood or misunderstood, might fear that their direct instruction causes them to be percieved as mean to the children. In this sense, I agree with Colten. I also think Hannah's idea that this might relect the child-centered attitude common in our society to be very insightful. According to the text, miscommunication is very common beause the children are very young, so I think this is a very valid concern. Colten also mentioned that this illustrates how adult-adult type interactions are not suitable for children. This aligns with the message of the text, but I think it also reveals a flaw of the text, as the author sets very high expecations on what adults should act and talk like to children. Some of these expecations are more relevant of a typical adult-adult interaction, over an adult child-interaction. Thus, there is a slight contradiction on the ways we are told to act by the text.
      </p><p>Personally speaking, I find myself somewhat hesitant to provide children with direct instruction. Given our discussion here, I'll try doing it more in the future.</p> </div>
