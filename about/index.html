          <h2>Hi! I'm Forrest Chou, a senior at Palo Alto High School. I'm interested in science, particularly physics, and human psychology and development. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u3BJgvQD7D6Ro5iIVsy7Yj7OBfFfI14oODNNkqWg3d4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class = "resume-link">ECD Resume</a></h2>

    <div class="about-desc">
      <div class = "a"> <p>Here are some questions I respond to to describe myself!</p> </div>
      <div class = "q"> <p>Why did you take Early Childhood Development?  How or why is it meaningful to you?</p> </div>
      <div class = "a"> <p>I took ECD because I've always been curious about what influences a person's attitudes, beliefs, and skills. In this class, not only have I learned many theories that describe childhood development, but I have also gained many skills in curating children's abilities through our class fieldwork.</p> </div>
      <div class = "q"> <p>Has ECD changed you or your perspective in any way?  How does spending time with young children make you feel?  What have the children taught you? Do you view childhood differently now- if yes, how so? Do you view your own education differently now- if yes, how so?  Have you found hands on learning valuable-why?</p> </div>
      <div class = "a"> <p>ECD has given me the perspective of the teacher at elementary school, which has greatly increase my appreciation of childhood education. I love being with young children, as their spirit and energy always lift me. Something the children taught me is the importance of names. They expect me to know their names, and they respond very positively when I use their names and interact with them personally. For this and many other reasons, learning hands on has been really valuable to me by teaching me these lessons and changing the way I view my own childhood. It has shown me that, even at age 5, children have such differing intersts and personalities, which is relevant to development in every domain. I remain committed to learning more about childhood education and I want to keep contributing to children's childhood in the future.</p> </div>
      <div class = "q"> <p>What have you learned about play?  How have you increased the role of play in your life and/or your community?</p></div>
      <div class = "a"> <p>I have always felt that play is extremely useful in learning and developing other skills. When I was younger, pretend play and play with construction toys has increase my creativity, and even now, when I play with others, I learn social skills. I've definetly increased the role of play in my life this year, and I try to treat my extracurriculars as a playful challenge. I have definetly found activites to be more fun when I trat them as such. This class has given me the perspective I needed on play.</p></div>
      <div class = "q"> <p>What have you learned from this class and what can I expect to learn about you from looking at this portfolio?</p></div>
      <div class = "a"> <p>I have learned many theories and perspectives on childhood and childhood education. We covered Piaget, Erickson, Vygosky, Dewey, and many others. We also looked at education through a biosocial, cultural-social, and congnitive lens, and we built activites to specifically help the children develop skills in these domains. I'm really proud to showcase many of the activities and projects I created, some in partnership with others, in this class.</p></div>
