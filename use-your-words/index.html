        <h2>Here is another sample of the writing I have contributed to our class written discussions.</h2>

    <div class="about-desc">
      <div class = "q"> <p>Reflect on the following in 250 words:</p>
        <p>Explain what ideas and examples stood out most to you from this chapter.</p>
        <p>How does it challenge things you previously thought or experienced?</p>
        <p>How will you use this information when working with children? (Be specific)</p> </div>
      <div class = "a"> <p>While many previous chapters focus on how to communicate to the children, particularly on how to communicate directions to the children, this chapter focuses on how teachers can use discussions to propell children's learning forward. One thing that this chapter focuses is on is on spontaneous discussion, which are often intiallized by interuptions to group dicussions. The text urged that we earnestly consider how we can redirect it to the topic we have at hand. This approach balaneces the teachers original intention with treating the ideas and culture of the students with respect. This was definetly a tension I felt before while teaching in other areas, such as math, so I thnk that this is a good option. I will try to implement it in coordination with other techniques to help the group remain focused. The chapter also focused on how we can use discussions to meaningfully process and interpret information. The book offered an example of when children might use language wrong because they are still learning with Dante, and showed the teacher attempting to figure out why Dante misused language. This type of conversation can reveal the understanding of the children, prompting the teacher to guide the student towards a even richer understanding of life. This chopater thus earges the teachers to challenge the students to make meaningful converstaions, and I will continue to try to do that.</p> </div>
